# Commit

Generate a clean, conventional commit message for staged changes.

## CRITICAL RULES

**This command MUST NEVER include:**
- "Generated with Claude Code"
- "Generated by AI"
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- Any mention of Claude, Anthropic, or AI
- Any robot emojis or AI indicators
- Any automated generation attribution

**Commit messages must appear as written by a human developer.**

## Usage

```
/commit
```

Analyzes staged changes and generates a proper commit message.

## Process

1. **Analyze Changes**:
   - Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
   - Identify files modified, added, deleted
   - Understand the nature of changes

2. **Determine Type**:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation only
   - `style`: Formatting, no code change
   - `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes nor adds
   - `perf`: Performance improvement
   - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
   - `build`: Build system or dependencies
   - `ci`: CI configuration
   - `chore`: Other changes

3. **Generate Message**:
   - Concise subject line (< 72 chars)
   - Optional body explaining why
   - Reference issues if applicable

## Output Format

```
type(scope): short description

Optional longer description explaining the context
and reasoning behind the changes.

- Bullet point for multiple changes
- Another change

Closes #123
```

## Examples

### Simple Change
```
fix(parser): handle null values in JSON response

The API occasionally returns null for optional fields.
Added proper null handling to prevent crashes.
```

### Feature Addition
```
feat(api): add bulk order creation endpoint

- Accept array of orders in single request
- Process in batches of 100
- Return summary with success/failure counts

Closes #456
```

### Refactoring
```
refactor(etl): extract validation into separate module

Split monolithic transform.py into focused modules
for better testability and reuse.

No functional changes.
```

## Do NOT

- Include any AI/Claude attribution
- Add "Generated by" footers
- Use robot emojis
- Mention automation
- Include Co-Authored-By for AI

## After Generation

The command outputs the commit message. You can then:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<generated message>
EOF
)"
```
